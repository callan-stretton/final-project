# Spoken, not Stirred

A continuation from the final EDA group project. 
A movie quote quiz game where players take it in turns to guess the next famous line from a movie by speaking out loud into the deviceâ€™s microphone using speech-to-text technology, and getting a score as to how accurate they were. 

**NB** You will need to use the Chrome browser and a microphone to play.
